            Epoxy Paints is a two part coatings that was developed to provide solution on metal substrates due to its high
            adhesion on various substrates. The system generally uses 4:1 by volume mixing ratio, and dry overnight
            providing a tough, protective coating with extremely excellent hardness. There strength against various acids,
            alkalis & solvents makes them useful for factory cast iron, aluminium, mild steel, Galvanised steel, cast steel
            and reduces exposure and flammability related issues vis-Ã -vis solvent based coatings. Epoxy paints only does
            not work for exterior application as they chalk out or turns yellow due to UV exposure.
